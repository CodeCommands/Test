- Basic Post: â‚¹299 (7 days)
- Featured Post: â‚¹599 (highlighted, 14 days)
- Urgent Post: â‚¹999 (top placement, push notifications)
1. **Dynamic Pricing** (Based on):
- Job complexity (Doctor: â‚¹999, Nurse: â‚¹499, Compounder: â‚¹299)
- Duration (Per day: â‚¹199, Per month: â‚¹599, Permanent: â‚¹999)
- Location (Metro: Higher, Rural: Lower)

**Pros**: Simple, predictable, no payment handling
**Cons**: Limited revenue per transaction

### Model B: Subscription Model

**Structure**: Monthly/yearly employer subscriptions

|Plan        |Monthly|Yearly |Posts/Month|Features                     |
|------------|-------|-------|-----------|-----------------------------|
|Basic       |Free   |Free   |2          |Basic search                 |
|Professional|â‚¹1,999 |â‚¹19,999|10         |Analytics, priority support  |

**Why C2 is Problematic**:

### Model D: Hybrid Progressive Model (Recommended Strategy)

**Year 1**: Post-Based Charging

- Learn user behavior

**Year 2**: Add Subscriptions

### ðŸ’¡ **Revenue Model Recommendation**:

Start with **Model A (Post-Based)** with this structure:

- Regular Post: â‚¹299 for 7 days
- Featured Post: â‚¹599 for 14 days
- Urgent Hire: â‚¹999 for instant push to all relevant candidates

Keep it simple initially. After 6 months, introduce subscriptions for frequent posters.
