   - Determine data quality and cleanliness

3. **Visual Modeling**
   - Create entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs)
   - Map business entities to Salesforce objects
   - Document relationships between entities
   - Identify master-detail vs. lookup relationships

4. **Future-Proofing**
   - Consider potential business growth
   - Plan for evolving requirements
   - Build flexibility into the model
   - Consider integration needs with other systems

## Standard vs. Custom Objects

### When to Use Standard Objects

Standard objects should be your first choice when appropriate because they offer significant advantages over custom objects in many scenarios.

1. **Come with Built-in Functionality**
   - **Pre-configured Fields and Layouts**: Standard objects include commonly used fields (like Name, Owner, Created Date) and organized page layouts, saving significant setup time.
   - **Integrated Reporting**: Standard objects have pre-built report types, dashboard components, and analytics integration, enabling immediate business insights without custom configuration.
   - **Robust Automation Framework**: Benefit from pre-configured workflow rules, process builders, and approval processes specifically designed for standard business processes.
   - **Optimized Mobile Experience**: Standard objects are carefully designed for the Salesforce mobile app with appropriate layouts and functionality, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

2. **Integrate Seamlessly with Salesforce Features**
   - **Native Sales/Service Cloud Integration**: Standard objects power core features like opportunity management, lead conversion, and case management with sophisticated built-in processes.
   - **Lightning Experience Optimization**: Receive specialized Lightning components, actions, and path guidance tailored specifically for standard objects.
   - **AppExchange Compatibility**: Most AppExchange packages are built to integrate with standard objects, potentially saving thousands of dollars in custom integration work.
   - **Einstein AI Features**: Many AI-powered features are pre-trained on standard objects, offering immediate insights without custom model training.

3. **Receive Automatic Updates**
   - **Feature Enhancements**: Each release brings new functionality to standard objects without administrative effort (e.g., Opportunity Kanban views, Account Hierarchy visualizations).
   - **Performance Improvements**: Salesforce continuously optimizes standard object performance based on platform-wide usage patterns and data.
   - **Security Enhancements**: Receive automatic security updates addressing potential vulnerabilities without manual intervention.
   - **User Interface Improvements**: Benefit from UX research and enhancements applied to standard objects in each release.

4. **Common Standard Objects and Their Optimal Use Cases**
   - **Accounts**: Represent organizations you do business with. Best for B2B relationships, customer management, and partner tracking.
   - **Contacts**: Represent individuals associated with Accounts. Ideal for tracking individual relationships, communication history, and personal preferences.
   - **Opportunities**: Track potential sales and revenue. Perfect for sales pipeline management, forecasting, and revenue tracking with built-in stages and probability.
   - **Cases**: Manage customer inquiries and issues. Optimized for customer service with escalation rules, SLAs, and resolution tracking.
   - **Leads**: Manage prospective customers before qualification. Includes lead scoring, assignment rules, and conversion process to Accounts/Contacts/Opportunities.
   - **Campaigns**: Track marketing initiatives and responses. Features ROI tracking, influence models, and member management.
   - **Products**: Catalog items or services you sell. Includes pricing, categorization, and configuration options.
   - **Price Books**: Define pricing strategies. Supports multiple pricing structures for different customer segments or regions.
   - **Assets**: Track products purchased or installed for customers. Includes warranty tracking, service history, and lifecycle management.
   - **Solutions**: Store answers to common questions for knowledge management. Features categorization, ratings, and case association.
   - **Contracts**: Manage agreements with customers. Includes activation tracking, renewal processes, and contract hierarchy.

### When to Use Custom Objects

Create custom objects when:

1. **No Suitable Standard Object Exists**
   - The entity is unique to your business
   - The data structure doesn't fit standard objects
   - The business process is specialized

2. **Industry-Specific Requirements**
   - Healthcare: Patient records
   - Financial Services: Financial products
   - Manufacturing: Equipment records
   - Education: Student information

3. **External System Integration**
   - Mirroring data structures from external systems
   - Creating junction objects for complex integrations
   - Supporting specific API requirements

4. **Custom Business Processes**
   - Proprietary workflows
   - Unique approval chains
   - Specialized tracking needs

### Custom Object Best Practices

1. **Thorough Planning**
   - Document the purpose of the object
   - Define relationships to other objects
   - Identify required fields and validation rules
   - Plan for record lifecycle management

2. **Consider Object Limits**
   - Fields per object (max 500 or 800 depending on edition)
   - Relationship limits
   - Formula field compilation size
   - Rollup summary field limits

3. **API Integration Considerations**
   - Define API names strategically
   - Consider external ID fields
   - Plan for bulk data loading

### Extending Existing Objects vs. Creating New Objects

Deciding whether to extend an existing object (standard or custom) or create a new object is a critical architectural decision that significantly impacts your Salesforce implementation's long-term maintainability, usability, and performance.

#### When to Extend an Existing Object

1. **Data Belongs to the Same Entity**
   - The information is intrinsically a property or attribute of the existing entity
   - The data makes sense in the context of the existing object's purpose
   - The data relates to the same business process as the parent object
   - Users naturally expect to find this information on the existing object
   
   **Example**: Adding industry-specific fields to Account (like "Hospital Bed Count" for healthcare) is better than creating a new "Healthcare Facility" object when you're primarily working with Accounts.

2. **Reporting and Analysis Requirements**
   - The data needs to be reported alongside existing object data frequently
   - Users need to filter and segment based on both existing and new data points
   - Dashboards need to display the data in context of the existing object
   - The business analyzes this data as part of the same entity
   
   **Example**: Adding "Renewal Probability %" to Opportunity is better than tracking renewal data in a separate object if most reports need to show this alongside standard opportunity data.

3. **Process Continuity**
   - The data is part of the same business process flow
   - The same users work with both existing and new data
   - The data lifecycle matches the existing object's lifecycle
   - Automation needs to reference both sets of fields
   
   **Example**: Adding contract terms to the Opportunity object makes sense if they're negotiated as part of the sales process and referenced in the same workflows.

4. **UI/UX Considerations**
   - Users need to see the information on the same screen
   - The navigation experience would be disrupted by separating the data
   - The mobile experience requires unified access
   - Forms and data entry logically belong together
   
   **Example**: Adding support preference fields to Contact makes more sense than creating a separate "Contact Preferences" object if users need this information while interacting with contacts.

#### When to Create a New Object

1. **Distinct Entity with Independent Lifecycle**
   - The data represents a separate business entity conceptually
   - The data has a different lifecycle or retention policy
   - The data could relate to multiple records of the existing object
   - The data exists independently of the parent object
   
   **Example**: Create a "Product Issue" custom object rather than adding issue fields to the Case object if product issues can exist without customer cases and might relate to multiple cases.

2. **Specialized Security or Compliance Requirements**
   - The data requires different sharing settings than the parent object
   - The data is subject to unique compliance requirements
   - Different user groups need access to the data
   - The data requires specialized audit trails
   
   **Example**: Create a "Patient Health Record" object rather than extending Contact with health fields if medical data requires HIPAA compliance with specialized access controls.

3. **Volume and Performance Considerations**
   - The data would create very wide tables (approaching field limits)
   - The data has significantly higher volume than the parent object
   - The data is accessed through different patterns (high-frequency API calls)
   - The data requires specialized indexing strategies
   
   **Example**: Create a "Customer Interaction" object rather than adding interaction fields to Contact if you'll track thousands of interactions per contact, causing data skew.

4. **Different Business Process Ownership**
   - The data is managed by a different department or team
   - The data follows a separate approval or validation process
   - The data is updated on a different schedule or through different channels
   - The data triggers different automation workflows
   
   **Example**: Create a "Compliance Verification" object rather than adding compliance fields to Account if the compliance team manages this process independently from account management.

### Best Practices When Extending Existing Objects

When you decide to extend an existing object rather than create a new one, follow these best practices to maintain data integrity, system performance, and usability:

1. **Field Naming and Organization**
   - **Naming Convention Harmony**:
     - Respect existing naming patterns in the object
     - Use prefixes to group related custom fields (e.g., "HC_" for healthcare-specific fields)
     - Avoid naming conflicts with potential future Salesforce standard fields
     - Document field groups in field descriptions
   
   - **Page Layout Strategy**:
     - Create dedicated sections for custom field groups
     - Consider record types for significantly different field sets
     - Organize related fields logically in the same sections
     - Use dynamic forms in Lightning to show/hide custom sections contextually

2. **Preventing Field Duplication**
   - **Before Creating Fields**:
     - Thoroughly review ALL existing fields, including those not on current page layouts
     - Check field metadata with SOQL or the API to find hidden or unused fields
     - Review field usage in reports to identify similar existing fields
     - Consult with other admins/developers who might have created similar fields
   
   - **Field Audit Process**:
     - Create a dedicated sandbox for field testing before production deployment
     - Document justification for new fields vs. repurposing existing ones
     - Implement a field approval workflow involving key stakeholders
     - Conduct regular field usage audits to identify and merge duplicates

3. **Managing Existing Automation Conflicts**
   - **Discovery Phase**:
     - Map all automation touching the object before adding fields:
       - Workflow Rules
       - Process Builders
       - Flows
       - Triggers
       - Validation Rules
     - Document field dependencies in existing automation
     - Identify potential race conditions or trigger order issues
   
   - **Testing Strategy**:
     - Create test scenarios that exercise existing automation with new fields
     - Validate that existing validation rules accommodate new fields
     - Test all processes end-to-end in a full sandbox
     - Create integration tests if the object interacts with external systems

4. **Data Migration and Historical Data**
   - **Field Backfill Strategy**:
     - Create a plan for populating historical records with new field values
     - Consider performance impact of mass updates on large objects
     - Document default values for historical records when actual data is unavailable
     - Plan for staging updates to avoid system performance impacts
   
   - **Data Consistency Validation**:
     - Implement validation rules to ensure new data meets quality standards
     - Create reports comparing new fields with related existing fields
     - Establish data stewardship processes for ongoing data quality
     - Document exception handling for records that cannot be backfilled

5. **Impact on Integrations and APIs**
   - **API Version Management**:
     - Review API integrations that query or update the object
     - Test API calls with new fields in a sandbox
     - Update API documentation to reflect new fields
     - Consider backwards compatibility for existing integrations
   
   - **Data Mapping Updates**:
     - Revise integration data mappings to include new fields
     - Communicate changes to integration partners
     - Coordinate release timing with dependent systems
     - Create fallback plans if integration updates are delayed

6. **Reporting and Analytics Considerations**
   - **Report Type Updates**:
     - Update custom report types to include new fields
     - Review existing reports that might benefit from new fields
     - Update dashboards to incorporate new data points
     - Create sample reports showcasing new fields for user adoption
   
   - **Analytics Compatibility**:
     - Test Einstein Analytics datasets with new fields
     - Update formula fields that might reference changed data
     - Consider impact on existing calculated metrics
     - Document changes for report and dashboard owners

## Object Relationships

### Types of Relationships

1. **Lookup Relationships**
   - **Use when**: Objects have independent lifecycles
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Parent record can be deleted while child records remain
     - No roll-up summary fields
     - No required field option
     - Can be self-referential (e.g., Employee to Manager)
   - **Best for**: Optional associations between objects

2. **Master-Detail Relationships**
   - **Use when**: Child object cannot exist without parent
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Cascade deletion (deleting parent deletes children)
     - Roll-up summary fields available
     - Child records inherit sharing settings from parent
     - Required field by default
   - **Best for**: Strong dependencies between objects

3. **Many-to-Many Relationships**
   - Implemented using junction objects (see next section)
   - **Use when**: Records of one type can relate to multiple records of another type and vice versa

### Relationship Best Practices

1. **Limit Relationship Depth**
   - Avoid deep hierarchies (more than 5 levels)
   - Consider performance impact on queries
   - Be mindful of relationship query limits

2. **Strategic Relationship Planning**
   - Map out all relationships before implementation
   - Consider reporting needs
   - Plan for data migration

3. **Relationship Field Naming**
   - Be descriptive (e.g., "Primary Contact" vs. "Contact")
   - Include the object name for clarity
   - Maintain consistency across similar relationships

4. **Deletion Considerations**
   - Plan cascade deletion carefully
   - Consider record retention requirements
   - Implement validation rules where needed to prevent orphaned records

## Junction Objects

### Purpose and Usage

Junction objects connect two or more objects in a many-to-many relationship.

**Example**: A Product can be sold in multiple Stores, and a Store can sell multiple Products.

### When to Use Junction Objects

1. **True Many-to-Many Relationships**
   - Each record in Object A can relate to multiple records in Object B and vice versa
   - Example: Opportunities and Products (via OpportunityLineItem)

2. **Complex Relationships with Attributes**
   - The relationship itself has properties that need to be tracked
   - Example: Product pricing varies by Store, so you track price on the junction object

3. **Relationship History Tracking**
   - Need to maintain historical records of relationships
   - Example: Student course enrollment history

### Junction Object Implementation Best Practices

1. **Architectural Structure**
   - **Ideal Configuration**: Create two master-detail relationships to parent objects when possible. This provides:
     - Efficient data storage
     - Automatic sharing inheritance
     - Roll-up summary capabilities to both parent objects
     - Automatic cleanup when either parent is deleted (preventing orphaned junction records)
   
   - **Standard Object Limitations**: When one parent is a standard object that doesn't support master-detail (like User or Product), implement:
     - Master-detail relationship to the custom parent object
     - Lookup relationship to the standard object
     - Validation rules or triggers to enforce referential integrity for the lookup side
     - Batch cleanup processes to prevent orphaned records when standard object records are deleted
   
   - **Naming Convention Strategy**: Name the junction object to clearly indicate its connecting function:
     - Object-to-Object format (e.g., "AccountProject", "ContactCampaign")
     - Role-based when appropriate (e.g., "TeamMembership", "CourseEnrollment")
     - Include custom suffix for clarity in API contexts (e.g., "AccountProjectJunction__c")
     - Ensure API name reflects relationship purpose for long-term clarity

2. **Comprehensive Field Architecture**
   - **Relationship Fields**:
     - Master-detail fields to both parent objects (or master-detail + lookup when necessary)
     - Consider creating a formula field displaying meaningful information from parent records
     - Add compound identification fields that show the relationship clearly in list views
   
   - **Relationship Attribute Fields**: Junction objects shine when they capture relationship properties:
     - **Quantitative Measures**: Amount, quantity, percentage, allocation (e.g., hours assigned to a project)
     - **Qualitative Attributes**: Role, level, type, category (e.g., role of a contact in an opportunity)
     - **Status Tracking**: Current state, progress, approval stage (e.g., enrollment status in a course)
     - **Financial Details**: Price, discount, terms (e.g., special pricing for a product at a specific account)
   
   - **Temporal Relationship Fields**:
     - Start/end dates to track when the relationship is active
     - Created/modified timestamps for audit purposes
     - Historical timestamps for significant status changes
     - Frequency or recurrence patterns if relationship occurs periodically
   
   - **Administrative Fields**:
     - Active/Inactive flag for soft deletion or temporary suspension
     - Approval status for relationships requiring verification
     - Notes/Comments fields for relationship-specific observations
     - Source system identifier for integration scenarios

3. **Strategic Implementation Considerations**
   - **Master/Lookup Selection Criteria**: When forced to choose between master-detail and lookup:
     - Make the object with more restrictive security the master-detail side (security will inherit)
     - Choose the master-detail relationship for the parent where roll-up summaries are more valuable
     - Consider which parent's deletion should always cascade to the junction (make this the master-detail)
     - Make the more fundamental/stable object the master to reduce maintenance issues
   
   - **Reporting Strategy**:
     - Create custom report types joining all three objects
     - Build report templates that showcase common relationship queries
     - Consider creating summary fields on parent objects (via roll-ups) to simplify reporting
     - Document complex report building procedures for junction relationship analysis
   
   - **Record Access Design**:
     - Map out sharing implications of master-detail relationships
     - Document how junction records inherit security from master object
     - Create sharing rules specifically for junction access patterns
     - Consider app-specific requirements for junction record visibility

4. **Performance Engineering**
   - **Indexing Strategy**:
     - Create custom indexes on all foreign key fields (relationship fields)
     - Add indexes on status fields frequently used in filtering
     - Create compound indexes for fields commonly queried together
     - Document all custom indexes and their purpose for future administrators
   
   - **Query Optimization**:
     - Design queries that filter junction records before joining to parent objects
     - Implement selective queries that use indexed fields in WHERE clauses
     - Cache frequently accessed junction data in application structures
     - Use relationship queries efficiently to minimize SOQL statements
   
   - **Volume Management**:
     - Implement archiving strategies for historical junction records
     - Consider Big Objects for massive many-to-many relationships
     - Use platform events for high-volume transactional relationships
     - Design batch processing for junction object bulk operations that anticipate governor limits
   
   - **Monitoring Framework**:
     - Create dashboards monitoring junction object growth
     - Establish alerts for unusual junction record volume increases
     - Implement record count trending to predict storage needs
     - Document performance benchmarks for key junction-related processes

### Junction Object Example

**Scenario**: Consultants can work on multiple Projects, and Projects can have multiple Consultants.

**Implementation**:
1. Custom object: "ProjectAssignment" (junction object)
2. Master-detail relationship to Custom Object "Project"
3. Master-detail relationship to Standard Object "User" (or Custom Object "Consultant")
4. Additional fields:
   - Role on Project (picklist)
   - Hours Allocated (number)
   - Start Date (date)
   - End Date (date)
   - Billing Rate (currency)
   - Status (picklist)

## Field Best Practices

### Field Types and Selection

1. **Choose Appropriate Field Types**
   - Text: For names, descriptions (limit length appropriately)
   - Number: For quantities, amounts (specify decimal places)
   - Currency: For monetary values (respect currency locale settings)
   - Date/Datetime: For temporal information
   - Picklist: For predefined options (use standard picklists when available)
   - Checkbox: For boolean/yes-no values
   - Lookup/Master-Detail: For relationships
   - Formula: For calculated values
   - Roll-Up Summary: For aggregating child record data

2. **Field Type Optimization**
   - Use picklists instead of text fields for predictable values
   - Choose appropriate text field lengths
   - Select the right numeric precision
   - Consider indexing for frequently queried fields

### Field Creation Standards

1. **Required Fields**
   - **Strategic Implementation**: Only make a field required if the business process genuinely cannot proceed without this information. For every required field, ask: "Can this record serve its purpose without this data point?"
   - **User Experience Impact**: Each required field creates friction during record creation. Balance data completeness against user adoption - too many required fields lead to poor data quality as users find workarounds.
   - **Alternatives to Consider**: Instead of making fields required, consider:
     - Providing default values
     - Using validation rules that trigger only in specific scenarios (e.g., only require shipping address when order status changes to "Ready to Ship")
     - Implementing guided paths that encourage completion without blocking record creation
     - Using visual indicators for recommended fields
   - **Documentation**: Create a business justification document for each required field that explains:
     - Why the field is essential
     - What business processes depend on this data
     - What happens when the data is missing
     - Who approved this requirement

2. **Field Descriptions**
   - **Mandatory Practice**: **ALWAYS** include comprehensive field descriptions - this is non-negotiable. Fields without descriptions create technical debt and knowledge gaps.
   - **Content Guidelines**: Effective descriptions should:
     - Explain the business purpose and impact of the field
     - Describe acceptable values and formats
     - Reference related business processes
     - Clarify the difference between similar fields
     - Include department or team responsible for the data
   - **Integration Transparency**: Clearly mark fields used in integrations with:
     - The systems that read or write to this field
     - Transformation rules applied during integration
     - Update frequency and synchronization pattern
     - Error handling procedures
   - **Example Format**:
     ```
     Annual Revenue: Company's self-reported annual revenue in USD. 
     Used for account segmentation and qualification. 
     Sources: Manual entry, D&B integration (updates nightly).
     Values over $10M trigger Enterprise qualification workflow.
     Owner: Sales Operations
     ```

3. **Default Values**
   - **Strategic Implementation**: Well-designed defaults can:
     - Significantly improve data quality
     - Speed up record creation
     - Ensure consistency across records
     - Guide users toward standard processes
   - **Types of Defaults**:
     - **Static Defaults**: Fixed values that rarely change (e.g., Country = "United States" for US-focused businesses)
     - **Dynamic Defaults**: Values calculated at runtime:
       - Current user (for ownership or territory fields)
       - Current date/time (for timestamp fields)
       - Parent record values (for fields that often inherit values)
       - Values from custom settings (for organization-specific defaults)
   - **Documentation Requirements**: For each default value, document:
     - Business justification for the chosen default
     - Approval process that established this default
     - Expected override frequency
     - Impact on reporting and analytics

4. **Field-Level Security**
   - **Layered Approach**: Implement field security as a holistic strategy:
     - **Profile-Based FLS**: Base access on job function and department
     - **Permission Set Layering**: Add specialized access for specific roles within departments
     - **Record-Type Specific**: Consider different field visibility needs per record type
     - **Dynamic Forms**: Use dynamic forms in Lightning to show/hide fields contextually
   - **Security Matrix**: Create a documented field security matrix for each object showing:
     - Which profiles can see each field
     - Which profiles can edit each field
     - Which permission sets grant additional access
     - The business justification for each access decision
   - **Compliance Documentation**: For regulated industries, maintain:
     - Field-level data classification (PII, PHI, PCI, etc.)
     - Regulatory frameworks applying to each field (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, etc.)
     - Audit procedures for access changes
     - Data masking and encryption requirements
   - **Regular Auditing**: Establish a quarterly review process to verify field-level security remains appropriate as business requirements evolve

### Specialized Field Types

1. **Formula Fields**
   - Document the business logic and formula
   - Consider compilation size limits
   - Optimize complex formulas
   - Use comments within formulas for clarity

2. **Roll-Up Summary Fields**
   - Document the aggregation logic
   - Consider performance impact
   - Plan for record volume growth
   - Be aware of record limits

3. **External ID Fields**
   - Always create for integration scenarios
   - Enforce uniqueness when required
   - Consider case sensitivity
   - Index for performance

4. **Rich Text Fields**
   - Use sparingly due to storage considerations
   - Provide guidelines for content structure
   - Consider Lightning Experience compatibility

### Field Limits and Performance

1. **Field Quantity Limits**
   - Standard limit: 500 fields per object
   - Unlimited/Performance Edition: 800 fields per object
   - Plan for future growth
   - Regularly audit fields for usage

2. **Field Indexing**
   - Index fields frequently used in filters
   - Consider custom indexes for reporting fields
   - Understand auto-indexed fields (standard IDs, external IDs)
   - Document indexing strategy

3. **Field Dependencies**
   - Design dependent picklists carefully
   - Document dependency rules
   - Consider maintenance overhead
   - Test with large datasets

## Naming Conventions

Consistent, clear, and meaningful naming conventions are critical foundations for a maintainable Salesforce implementation. Properly named components improve developer productivity, administrator effectiveness, and overall system clarity.

### Object Naming Conventions

1. **API Names**
   - **Formatting Standard**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `CustomerOrder__c`) with each word capitalized and no spaces or underscores between words.
   - **Clarity Over Brevity**: Choose descriptive names that clearly communicate the object's purpose rather than cryptic abbreviations.
     - **Good**: `ProjectDeliverable__c`
     - **Avoid**: `PrjDlvrbl__c`
   
   - **Abbreviation Policy**: 
     - Avoid abbreviations except for universally recognized industry terms (e.g., `VIN__c` for Vehicle Identification Number).
     - Document all approved abbreviations in a central glossary.
     - Be consistent with abbreviation usage across the entire org.
   
   - **Namespace Management**:
     - For managed packages, include the namespace prefix in all documentation.
     - For future packaging, design names anticipating namespace prefixing.
     - When working with multiple packages, use distinguishing prefixes before the namespace to avoid confusion.
   
   - **Character Restrictions**:
     - Strictly avoid special characters, including spaces and underscores (except the required `__c` suffix).
     - Avoid double underscores except for the required `__c` suffix.
     - Never begin names with numbers.
   
   - **Length Considerations**:
     - Keep names under 40 characters when possible (helps with readability in code).
     - Balance descriptiveness with length - overly long names become unwieldy in code.
     - If abbreviations are necessary due to length constraints, document them thoroughly.
   
   - **Semantic Patterns**:
     - Use singular nouns for object names (e.g., `CustomerOrder__c` not `CustomerOrders__c`).
     - For objects that represent relationships, combine the related object names (e.g., `AccountPartnership__c`).
     - For objects that represent activities or events, use a verbal noun (e.g., `InvoicePayment__c`).

2. **Label Names**
   - **Business Terminology Alignment**:
     - Use terms recognizable to business users, not just technical terms.
     - Solicit input from key stakeholders in different departments.
     - Align with industry-standard terminology when applicable.
     - Update labels when business terminology evolves (API names remain stable).
   
   - **Salesforce Ecosystem Consistency**:
     - Review existing Salesforce standard object labels before creating custom labels.
     - Maintain consistency with Salesforce standard terminology (e.g., "Account" not "Customer" for B2B).
     - Follow similar patterns to standard objects for related custom objects.
   
   - **Formatting Guidelines**:
     - Use Title Case for multi-word labels (e.g., "Customer Order" not "Customer order").
     - Use spaces between words for readability.
     - Include articles and prepositions when they improve clarity.
     - Consider label length limits on page layouts and reports.
   
   - **Internationalization Planning**:
     - For multi-language orgs, consider how labels will translate.
     - Avoid idioms, colloquialisms, or culturally specific references.
     - Document translation context for all labels.
     - Test label display in different languages for UI layout issues.
   
   - **Plural Label Handling**:
     - Provide appropriate plural labels during object creation.
     - Consider irregular plurals carefully (e.g., "Person" → "People").
     - For acronyms, follow organization style guide for pluralization (e.g., "KPIs" vs "KPI's").

### Field Naming Conventions

1. **API Names**
   - Use camelCase (e.g., `orderAmount__c`)
   - Be descriptive but concise
   - Include unit of measure if applicable (e.g., `revenueUSD__c`)
   - Indicate field type for special fields (e.g., `isActive__c` for checkbox)
   - For relationship fields, use the object name (e.g., `primaryContact__c`)

2. **Label Names**
   - Use proper capitalization (Title Case typically)
   - Include units where appropriate (e.g., "Revenue (USD)")
   - Be consistent across similar fields
   - Consider field arrangement on page layouts when naming

### Relationship Field Naming

1. **Lookup/Master-Detail Fields**
   - API Name: Related object + `Id` (e.g., `accountId__c`)
   - Label: Descriptive relation (e.g., "Primary Account")
   - Include relationship type for clarity when needed

2. **Junction Object Naming**
   - API Name: Combine related objects (e.g., `AccountContact__c`)
   - Consider alphabetical ordering for consistency
   - Label: Description of relationship (e.g., "Account-Contact Relationship")

### Picklist Value Naming

1. **Consistency**
   - Use same case style across all values (typically Title Case)
   - Maintain consistent terminology
   - Use parallel language structure
   - Avoid abbreviations unless space-constrained

2. **Sorting Considerations**

## Data Migration Considerations

Effective data migration is critical to the success of any Salesforce implementation. A poorly executed migration can undermine user adoption and data integrity, while a well-planned migration establishes trust in the system and enables immediate business value.

### Pre-Migration Planning

1. **Comprehensive Data Mapping**
   - **Source-to-Target Field Analysis**:
     - Create detailed mapping documents that show every source field and its corresponding target field
     - Document data types and length constraints for each field pair
     - Identify fields that don't have direct mappings and require special handling
     - Specify field-level validation rules that migrated data must satisfy
     - Document required vs. optional fields in the target system
   
   - **Data Transformation Strategy**:
     - Define specific transformation rules for each field requiring modification:
       - Format changes (e.g., date formats from MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD)
       - Value mappings (e.g., converting status values from "A/I/P" to "Active/Inactive/Pending")
       - Unit conversions (e.g., dollars to local currency, imperial to metric)
       - Text case normalization (e.g., proper case for names, uppercase for codes)
     - Create test cases for each transformation rule
     - Document handling of special characters, non-ASCII text, and encoding issues
     - Identify fields requiring concatenation or splitting (e.g., full name to first/last)
   
   - **Default Value Framework**:
     - Identify fields requiring default values when source data is missing
     - Document business justification for each default value
     - Create tiered default strategy (field-specific defaults vs. global defaults)
     - Consider dynamic defaults based on other field values or business rules
     - Validate default values against validation rules and business processes
   
   - **Record Ownership Allocation**:
     - Design algorithm for assigning Salesforce record owners
     - Map source system users to Salesforce users
     - Create contingency plans for records owned by inactive users
